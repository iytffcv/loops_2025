# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(len(fruits))
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
for subject in subjects:
    if subject == "history":
        break
    print(subject)

    for subject in subjects:
        if subjects == "science":
            continue
        print(subject)


        list1000 = list(range(1, 1001))
        
        for number in list1000:
            if number > 599:
                break
            print(number)

            for numbers in list1000:
               if 300<= number <= 500:
                   continue
               print(number)

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"

# Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
